## 1. WHY DID WE CREATE THIS TOOL ? 

It was complicated to retrieve all the data concerning a mission, you had to call your colleagues, ask them what they did or find.
The goal is really to have a global vision of the mission, to be organized, to wake up and say "okay, I still have to look at it".
